# Multi-task Learning Approach for Intracranial Hemorrhage Prognosis

This repository contains the code of the paper **Multi-task Learning Approach for Intracranial Hemorrhage Prognosis**, accepted at Machine Learning in Medical Imaging workshop @ MICCAI 2024 (MLMI). For our submitted manuscript with added funding acknowledgements and authors' names and affiliations, but without post submission improvements or corrections, please click [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08784). The final version is now published [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-73290-4_2). The pretrained models are available [here](https://huggingface.co/MiriamCobo/MultitaskLearning_ICH_Prognosis).

In this study, we aim to enhance image-based prognosis by learning a robust feature representation shared between pronosis and the clinical and demographic variables most highly correlated with it. Our approach mimics clinical decision-making by reinforcing the model to learn valuable prognostic data embedded in the image. We propose a 3D multi-task image model to predict prognosis, Glasgow Coma Scale and age, improving accuracy and interpretability, as shown below.

Our method outperforms current state-of-the-art baseline image models, and demonstrates superior performance in ICH prognosis compared to four board-certified neuroradiologists using only CT scans as input.
